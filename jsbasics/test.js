const accountId=14
let email="sansi@23"
let password="123"
city="jaipur" //not preferable but possible
let accountState; //if we print its value it will be undefined

//var is not used now due to scope problem

//console.table([accountId,email]) -> using console.table we can print all variables together
console.table([accountId,email,password])
//ecma -> wrote javascript standards
